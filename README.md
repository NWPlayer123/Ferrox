# Ferrox
Ferrox is a work-in-progress disassembler and decompiler meant as an alternative to Hex-Rays's IDA or the
NSA's Ghidra. This allows for flexibility to make different design decisions, such as better support for C++
features, as well as better integration in a typical decompilation pipeline.

Ferrox is currently in early development and not meant to be production ready. Expect bugs and missing
features!
